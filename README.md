# 🌱 Paradise Nursery Shopping App

A plant e-commerce site I built to practice Redux state management and React hooks. Features a fully functional shopping cart with add/remove items, quantity controls, and real-time price calculations.

**Note:** The layout isn't fully responsive across all screen sizes—I focused on getting the Redux logic working rather than perfecting the CSS.

**Tech Stack:** React, Redux Toolkit, Vite
